--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stellarium is a free GPL software which renders realistic skies in real time
with openGL. It is available for Linux/Unix, Windows and MacOSX. With
Stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, binoculars or a
small telescope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environment
A 3d openGL acceleration card and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys or drag with the mouse to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys or mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the F1 key for more help.

More help can be found on www.stellarium.org, and in the user guide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From version 0.6.0 the most useful configuration options can be set from within
the program.
You can however change it by hand in the file config.ini in the user data
directory.  See http://www.stellarium.org/doc/head/fileStructure.html
for more details on the location of the user data directory for your OS.

1. Technical Articles
	1.1 The tone reproductor class
		The class mainly performs a fast implementation of the algorithm
		from the paper [1], with more accurate values from [2]. The blue
		shift formula is taken from [3] and combined with the Scotopic
		vision formula from [4].

			Rushmeier, IEEE Computer Graphics & Application, November
			1993

		[4] "A Visibility Matching Tone Reproduction Operator for High
			Dynamic Range Scenes", G.W. Larson, H. Rushmeier, C. Piatko
	1.2 The skylight class
		The class is a fast implementation of the algorithm from the
		article "A Practical Analytic Model for Daylight" by A. J.
		Preetham, Peter Shirley and Brian Smits.
	1.3 The skybright class
		The class is a fast reimplementation of the VISLIMIT.BAS basic
		source code from Brad Schaefer's article on pages 57-60,  May
		1998 _Sky & Telescope_,	"To the Visual Limits". The basic
		sources are available on the Sky and Telescope web site.
		(code "offered as-is and without support.")

2. Included source code
	2.1 Some computation of the sideral time (sideral_time.h/c) and pluto
        orbit contains code from the libnova library (LGPL) by Liam Girdwood.
	2.2 The orbit.cpp/h and solve.h files are directly borrowed from
		Celestia (Chris Laurel). (GPL license)
	2.3 Several implementations of IMCCE theories for planet and satellite
		movement by Johannes Gajdosik (MIT-style license,
		see the corresponding files for the license text)
    2.4 The tesselation algorithms were originally extracted from the glues 
        library version 1.4 Mike Gorchak <mike@malva.ua> (SGI FREE SOFTWARE
        LICENSE B).

3. Data
	3.1 The Hipparcos star catalog
		From ESA (European Space Agency) and the Hipparcos mission.
		ref. ESA, 1997, The Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues, ESA SP-1200
		http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/I/239
	3.2 The solar system data mainly comes from IMCCE and partly from
		Celestia.
	3.3 Polynesian constellations are based on diagrams from the Polynesian
		Voyaging Society
	3.4 Chinese constellations are based on diagrams from the Hong Kong
		Space Museum
	3.5 Egyptian constellations are based on the work of Juan Antonio
		Belmonte, Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias
	3.6 The Tycho-2 Catalogue of the 2.5 Million Brightest Stars
		Hog E., Fabricius C., Makarov V.V., Urban S., Corbin T.,
		Wycoff G., Bastian U., Schwekendiek P., Wicenec A.
		<Astron. Astrophys. 355, L27 (2000)>
		http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/I/259
	3.7 Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD) version 1
		http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad
		Norbert Zacharias writes:
		"There are no fees, both UCAC and NOMAD are freely available
		with the only requirement that the source of the data (U.S.
		Naval Observatory) and original product name need to be provided
		with any distribution, as well as a description about any
		changes made to the data, if at all."
		The changes made to the data are:
		-) try to compute visual magnitude and color from the b,v,r
		   values
		-) compute nr_of_measurements = the number of valid b,v,r values
		-) throw away or keep stars (depending on magnitude,
		   nr_of_measurements, combination of flags, tycho2 number)
		-) add all stars from hiparcos (incl. component solutions), and
		   tycho2+1st supplement
		-) reorganize the stars in several brigthness levels and
		   triangular zones according to position and magnitude
		The programs that are used to generate the star files are called
		"MakeCombinedCatalogue", "ParseHip", "ParseNomad", and can be
		found in the util subdirectory in source code. The position,
		magnitudes, and proper motions of the stars coming from NOMAD
		are unchanged, except for a possible loss of precision,
		especially in magnitude. When there is no v-magnitude, it is
		estimated from r or b magnitude.  When there is no b- or v-
		magnitude, the color B-V is estimated from the other magnitudes.
		Also proper motions of faint stars are neglected at all.
